*Connection Games* are a genre of *Abstract Board Games*, with *Zig-Zag* being a relatively unknown and unstudied Connection Game whose board consists of a numbered 6x6 grid, with the players rolling die to progress their piece vertical towards the end goal.

For my Bachelorâ€™s thesis, I conducted original research on this unstudied game, developing winning theories and deducing the strongest board cells. A simple yet efficient Zig-Zag computer game was developed which can compete against a human opponent.

## Overview
- Developed using Java
- Awarded the Undergraduate Award for Mathematics
- First known in-depth analysis of the Connection Game Zig-Zag
- First known computer game implementation of Zig-Zag
- AI utilized a Monte-Carlo approach and could compete against an experienced human opponent where it won every 1 out of 2 games. Each turn took less than a second to compute.
